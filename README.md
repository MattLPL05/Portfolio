There are ussually 3 kinds of scripts i like to write, and they can be indentified by their specific naming:

Scripts containing "basic" in their name, are ussually responsible to make life easier, by being scripts that can be used universaly for many situations. Most of the time they do - as the name suggests - very basic things, with a lot of options. Very easy to use.

Scripts containing "handler" in their name, serve as the "bigger", more "dedicated" scripts most of the time. They ussually contain the most, sometimes entire code behind a specific object. Handlers serve a purpose of being scripted specificly for just one thing, and not be used on other Gameobjects that the handler was not meant for.

Scripts that do not contain "basic" or "handler" in their name, ussually land beetween these 2 classifications of mine.
